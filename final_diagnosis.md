# Final Diagnosis: The Working Solution Uses Single VLAN

## Critical Discovery

The **working repository examples achieve 100% connectivity using SINGLE VLAN L2 switching**, NOT multi-VLAN inter-VLAN routing!

### Evidence from Documentation:
```
Host Layer: h1(10.0.0.1) h2(10.0.0.2) h3(10.0.0.3) h4(10.0.0.4)
```

**All hosts are in 10.0.0.x subnet** - same VLAN!

### Working Configuration Pattern:
- **Single VLAN 100** with `unicast_flood: true`
- **All hosts** in same subnet (10.0.0.x/24)
- **No inter-VLAN routing needed** - pure L2 switching
- **All inter-switch ports** use `native_vlan: 100`

### Our Current Problem:
- We're attempting **multi-VLAN inter-VLAN routing** (complex)
- Working solution uses **single VLAN L2 switching** (simple)
- **Same-switch works** because it's L2 within VLAN
- **Cross-switch fails** because we're doing L3 routing

## Solution Path

### Option 1: Use Single VLAN (Match Working Pattern)
```yaml
# Like working_minimal.yaml
vlans:
  100:
    description: "default VLAN"
    unicast_flood: true
    
# All hosts: 10.0.0.x/24 (same subnet)
# All ports: native_vlan: 100
```

### Option 2: Fix Multi-VLAN Routing (Advanced)
- Debug inter-VLAN routing configuration
- Ensure proper ARP resolution between subnets
- Validate router flows in Faucet

## Recommendation

**Test the simple single-VLAN approach first** (`--topology simple`) to validate the proven working pattern, then work on scaling to multi-VLAN if needed.

The repository's "100% success" is achieved with single VLAN, not complex inter-VLAN routing.
